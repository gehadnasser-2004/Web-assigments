            <h2>steps to make the recipe</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter and line a 2-litre loaf tin. Put the butter, honey, treacle, chopped stem ginger and ginger syrup in a small pan over a low heat until the butter has melted. Set aside to cool for a few minutes, then pour in the milk and leave to cool for around 15 mins.</li>
                <li>Sift the flour, bicarb and spices into a large bowl, then pour in the milk mixture, stirring to combine. Beat in the egg, then tip the mixture into the prepared tin. Bake in the oven for 1 hr, or until the cake is cooked through and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for 15 mins, then turn out to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
